# Droid Please - AI-Powered Project Management CLI

## Project Overview
A CLI tool that serves as an AI coding assistant, leveraging Anthropic's Claude to enable natural language interactions for project management and file operations. Users can issue commands in plain English to manipulate files and manage their codebase.

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.10+
- Key Dependencies:
  - `anthropic`: Claude AI integration
  - `typer`: CLI framework
  - `rich`: Terminal formatting
  - `pydantic`: Data validation
  - `poetry`: Dependency management

## Core Components
1. **CLI Interface** (`main.py`)
   - Entry point for the application
   - Handles command routing and user interaction
   - Implements interactive and direct command modes

2. **Agent System** (`agent.py`)
   - Manages communication with Claude AI
   - Handles message streaming and tool execution
   - Maintains conversation context

3. **File Operations** (`agent_tools.py`)
   - Core file manipulation functions:
     - read_file: File content reading
     - create_file: File creation
     - update_file: Content modification
     - rename_file: File renaming
     - delete_path: File/directory deletion
     - ls: Directory listing
